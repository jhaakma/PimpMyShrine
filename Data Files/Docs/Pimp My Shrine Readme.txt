Incompatibilities
==============
Not Compatible with OpenMW
Minor conflict with NoM (uses the same bookshelf at Jobasha's Rare Books.)

F.A.Q
====
1. So, how do I begin the quest again?
	Jobasha's Rare Books, read "Legend of Vernaccus", it's on a bookshelf.
2. Can I play this mod with OpenMW? Can you make a patch for OpenMW? When will this mod be compatible with OpenMW?﻿
	No. No. No.
3. I don't care about furniture, why should I play this mod?
	Placing furniture is but one aspect of the mod. Even without it, you still get a full quest with very cool dungeons and ﻿rewards.
4. So it's a house mod, I don't care about that?﻿
	Dynamically adding rooms to the shrine is but one aspect of the mod. Even without it, you still get a full quest with very ﻿cool dungeons and rewards.
5. The Transmutation spell does not work.
	Make sure MWSE 2.1 is installed and updated﻿
	Make sure you have Magicka Expanded installed (you only need the Framework module.)
6. I have  big yellow !!! in the shrine and many warning about missing meshes and textures.
	Make you have OAAB_Data.esm installed.
7. The game crashed when I picked up the book / when I entered the shrine
	Make sure you have the MCP option ticked: hi-def cutscene.
8. I can't rotate the furniture in the shop
	Update MWSE (run MWSE-Update.exe, it is in your Morrowind directory)
9. I followed the instructions but there is a bug.
	We'll be able to help if you explain clearyl the issue AND send your MWSE.log (it's in your Morrowind directory).
